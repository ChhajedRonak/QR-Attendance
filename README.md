# QR-Attendance
Attendance system using QR Code.

The current system requires to manually take roll calls and feed it into the system which is extremely time consuming and tedious process for the faculty.
Our system:
A portal will be built where the faculty needs to login and select time and subject. The QR Code will be generated and displayed on the projector. The students will scan the QR codes using the android app hereby marking their attendance.
